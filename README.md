# gpg-atom package

gpg-atom plugin utilise gpg to encrypt and decrypt file in atom.
This plugin is not ready to use yet.

## Commands
- gpg-atom:encrypt
- gpg-atom:decrypt

## Notes
This is my first plugin in atom. When you find something I should not do, pleas let me know ;-)

## TODO
- add settings section
- add tests to specs
- try to decrypt on the fly but do it in some kind of tmp buffer
- changes in tmp buffer should be saved encrypted
- detect encryption over extension (\*.asc)
- detect encryption over content (-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----)
